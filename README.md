## Music recommendation comparison
Brief introduction:
Bands are recommended to users based on the number of playback times. 
The number of songs played by users represents the user's liking for the band
Model algorithms of User_CF,Item_CF,LFM,BPR and ALS_WR were used for solving and comparing
Measures adopted: Accuracy, recall, coverage, diversity
- Data set (two copies of data):
1. lastfm-360K(small_data.csv) Take the 10000 most active users and 1000 most popular songs
2. Million Song Datasets -- u.data,lable encoded small data
#### 1.User-based collaborative filtering
      The similarity of users is calculated. If two users have behaviors on unpopular items, the two users should have high similarity
#### 2.Item-based collaborative filtering
      To calculate the similarity of items, active users should contribute less to the similarity of items than inactive users
#### 3.Lingo model (LFM)
    Connect users and items through implicit features
      Parameter: The number of implicit features
        Learning rate alph
        The regularization term coefficient lamba
#### 4.BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking
    Maximizing a posteriori probability based on Bayesian theory under prior knowledge, realizing training multiple matrices from a user-item matrix,
    And each matrix represents a user's project preferences to obtain the partial order relationship of multiple items for the user to sort the recommendation system

#### 5.ALS_WRï¼šALS with Weighted--Regularization
        Users do not give clear feedback on their preference for commodities, or score directly. Users' preference for commodities can be inferred through certain behaviors of users
        ALS_WR is measured by confidence
